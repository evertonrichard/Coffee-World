    <h2>Some News</h2>

   <p>A coffee website has introduced a new feature called 'Location-Based Search' that allows customers to search for coffee shops based on their proximity to a specific location. This feature uses the customer's GPS location to show nearby coffee shops on a map, making it easier for customers to find cafes that are close to them and discover new ones in their area.</p>
